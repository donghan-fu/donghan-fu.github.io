Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Donghan Fu, and I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Information Science and Learning Technologies (SISLT)](https://cehd.missouri.edu/information-science-learning-technologies/degrees-programs/information-science-learning-technologies-phd/) at the University of Missouri-Columbia (MU). My research lies at the intersection of **Human-Computer and AI Interaction, Educational Technology, and AI for Science Communication and Education**. I am particularly interested in how generative AI is transforming the ways people communicate, understand, and learn STEM subjects.

By integrating emerging media technologies with theories from educational psychology, my work aims to address real-world challenges in science learning. I focus on identifying the difficulties learners face and exploring how generative AI can be designed to enhance both communication and educational outcomes.

I hold a Ph.D. in Communication from [Beijing Normal University (BNU)](https://sjc.bnu.edu.cn/), during which I was a visiting scholar in the department of Communication Arts at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2024. I earned an M.A. in Journalism and Communication from [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://journal.whu.edu.cn/), as well as dual bachelor’s degrees: a B.S. in Chemistry from Central China Normal University (CCNU) and a B.A. in Advertising from WHU. Prior to joining SISLT at Mizzou, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at WHU from 2024 to 2025.

Through this program and in my future work, I will support learners like myself—who once struggled with STEM—by harnessing technology-empowered, evidence-based solutions to boost engagement and improve learning outcomes. I’m also passionate about practical design, from application development to AI-product innovation. My research aims not only to advance the fields of learning analytics and AI for education but also to forge strong industry partnerships. I warmly invite colleagues and collaborators from academia, industry, and educational institutions to connect and explore possibilities together.
