Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Donghan Fu, and I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Information Science and Learning Technologies (SISLT)](https://cehd.missouri.edu/information-science-learning-technologies/degrees-programs/information-science-learning-technologies-phd/) at the University of Missouri-Columbia (MU). My research lies at the intersection of **Human-Computer and AI Interaction, Educational Technology, and AI for Science Communication and Education**. I am particularly interested in how generative AI is transforming the ways people communicate, understand, and learn STEM subjects.

By integrating emerging media technologies with theories from educational psychology, my work aims to address real-world challenges in science learning. I focus on identifying the difficulties learners face and exploring how generative AI can be designed to enhance both communication and educational outcomes.

I hold a Ph.D. in Communication from [Beijing Normal University (BNU)](https://sjc.bnu.edu.cn/), during which I was a visiting scholar in the department of Communication Arts at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2024. I earned an M.A. in Journalism and Communication from [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://journal.whu.edu.cn/), as well as dual bachelor’s degrees: a B.S. in Chemistry from Central China Normal University (CCNU) and a B.A. in Advertising from WHU. Prior to joining SISLT at Mizzou, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at WHU from 2024 to 2025.

Through this program and in my future work, I will support learners like myself—who once struggled with STEM—by harnessing technology-empowered, evidence-based solutions to boost engagement and improve learning outcomes. I’m also passionate about practical design, from application development to AI-product innovation. My research aims not only to advance the fields of learning analytics and AI for education but also to forge strong industry partnerships. I warmly invite colleagues and collaborators from academia, industry, and educational institutions to connect and explore possibilities together.

# 📝 Academic Path
***Phase One: From Chemistry to Communication (CCNU → WHU) [2014-2018]***
Growing up in a traditional Chinese family, I was encouraged to pursue chemistry at a teacher’s college—a path considered stable and “appropriate” for girls, despite my limited interest and challenges in mathematics. At Central China Normal University (CCNU), I became increasingly aware of gender disparities in STEM: male faculty predominantly held research positions, while female faculty were largely assigned teaching roles. While my chemistry lectures often felt disconnected from practical application, hands-on lab activities, like building molecular models, made learning tangible and engaging. During my teaching internship, I witnessed how rigid, exam-oriented instruction often stifled students’ curiosity, especially among girls.

  <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #555;">Students often find chemistry boring and hard to learn.</p>
</div>
These disappointing experiences motivated me to transfer from chemistry education to communication studies, aiming to create more supportive STEM learning environments for girls.


***Phase Two: Communication Studies at WHU and BNU [2018-2024]***
Recognizing the gap in China’s educational system in integrating STEM with media technology, I pursued a master’s degree in Communication and Media at WHU, followed by doctoral studies at BNU. There, I explored how AI-driven virtual news anchors shape audience engagement and examined the immersive potential of VR/AR in vividly reconstructing global events such as the Syrian crisis. 

These experiences deepened my interest in how emerging technologies can address educational inequalities, particularly in overcoming gender biases and supporting **personalized, adaptive STEM learning.** From my perspective, theories are not static or abstract; they come alive as we witness technology actively reshaping society. My goal is to bridge communication and media theory with educational practice to drive meaningful, real-world impact.

***Phase Three: University of Wisconsin-Madison -- A Commitment to Pursuing Higher Education in the U.S. to Empower the Next Generation [2023-]***
My time as a visiting scholar at the University of Wisconsin–Madison was a pivotal moment in my academic journey. It was the first time I realized that theory could be engaging and even captivating, reinforcing my belief that science becomes truly compelling when taught through effective and creative methods. Collaborating with research groups that integrated **computational approaches** with communication studies further showed me how technology can advance both scientific understanding and social impact. This interdisciplinary perspective resonated deeply with my interests—interests that I had found difficult to fully pursue within the more traditional, communication-focused academic environment in China. 

Inspired by the transformative power of science and technology in expanding educational access, I chose to pursue my Ph.D. studies in the SISLT at Mizzou. Here, I aim to develop inclusive, innovative solutions that address global educational disparities and empower the next generation of learners.
